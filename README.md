# susographql

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The susographql allows you to use the Survey Solutions GraphQL
endpoints. A detailed documentation can be found
[here](https://demo.mysurvey.solutions/graphql/), the package itself
only contains a very rudimentary documentation.

This is currently a beta version, which means the package is under
(active) development. It is recommended that only users who are familiar
on how to use packages in development should use this pacakage. And
certainly users are also invited to suggest improvements or to add their
own functions to the package by forking.
