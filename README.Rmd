<div align="justify">
The `susographql` R package offers a comprehensive interface to the World Bank's [Survey Solutions](https://mysurvey.solutions/en/) Computer Assisted Survey System (CASS) via its GraphQL API. This package supports all current queries and mutations, seamlessly integrating the latest advancements like map uploads. It harnesses the power of the modern [httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org/index.html) package, ensuring a streamlined and efficient user experience without the need for external GraphQL client packages.

Beyond basic API interactions, `susographql` brings an assortment of helper functions. These are thoughtfully designed to simplify the use of query filters, elevating the user experience and broadening your data manipulation and retrieval capabilities. Dive into the details of the Survey Solutions GraphQL queries and mutations in our comprehensive [documentation](https://demo.mysurvey.solutions/graphql/).

While `susographql` is crafted as a "bare-bone" API client, delivering data largely in its original server format, it offers users unmatched flexibility. This approach ensures minimal data manipulation in the background, catering to users who prefer a hands-on approach to data handling. For those who seek a more deterministic experience with built-in data transformations and ready-to-use data structures, we recommend our [SurveySolutionsAPI (httr version)](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPI) or the newer [SurveySolutionsAPIv2 (httr2 version)](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPIv2).
