<div align="justify">

The `susographql` R package offers a comprehensive interface to the World Bank's [Survey Solutions](https://mysurvey.solutions/en/) Computer Assisted Survey System (CASS) via its GraphQL API. This package supports all current queries and mutations, seamlessly integrating the latest advancements like map uploads. It harnesses the power of the modern [httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org/index.html) package, ensuring a streamlined and efficient user experience without the need for external GraphQL client packages.

Beyond basic API interactions, `susographql` brings an assortment of helper functions. These are thoughtfully designed to simplify the use of query filters, elevating the user experience and broadening your data manipulation and retrieval capabilities. Dive into the details of the available Survey Solutions GraphQL queries and mutations in the comprehensive [API documentation](https://demo.mysurvey.solutions/graphql/).

While `susographql` is crafted as a "bare-bone" API client, delivering data largely in its original server format, it offers users unmatched flexibility in designing their own, more complex processes fully customized to their needs. This approach also means minimal data manipulation in the background, catering to users who prefer a hands-on approach to data handling. For those who seek a more deterministic experience with built-in data transformations and ready-to-use data structures including support for integration in an R Shiny application, we recommend our [SurveySolutionsAPI (httr version)](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPI) or the newer [SurveySolutionsAPIv2 (httr2 version)](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPIv2), which cover both, the [Survey Solutions REST API](https://demo.mysurvey.solutions/apidocs/index.html) and the GraphQL API handled in this package[^1].



## Installation

You can either install the stable version from CRAN:

```{r devtoolsinst,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

install.packages("susographql")

```


Or install the development version with:

```{r install,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

devtools::install_github("michael-cw/susographql")

```


## Using the API client 

1. Set up your own personal [Survey Solutions Server](https://mysurvey.solutions/en/) or request a free [Personal Demo Server (PDS)](https://pds.mysurvey.solutions/PersonalDemoServerRequest) (for testing only!!).
2. Set up your [API user and credentials](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/accounts/teams-and-roles-tab-creating-user-accounts/).
3. Use the credentials to connect to the server.

Contrary to its bigger sisters, the [SurveySolutionsAPI (httr version)](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPI) and the [SurveySolutionsAPIv2 (httr2 version)](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPIv2) this package does not come with a lot of helpers for credential handling and setting, nevertheless a light-weight credentials check is included:

```{r pwcheck, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(susographql)

suso_gql_pwcheck(
  endpoint = "https://demo.mysurvey.solutions/graphql",
  user = "someuser",
  password = "andhispassword",
  workspace = "primary"
)

```

Which returns either **200** if the credentials are correct and **400** if incorrect. Also note, that the endpoint requires the full path including the **graphql** part at the end.

## Feature requests and bug reports

You can either use the standard GitHub approach by filing a bug report/feature request [here](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPI/issues) or you use the Survey Solutions user forum.

Please continue to check for updates, as we are constantly working to improve the package as well as integrating any new GraphQL queries or mutations as soon as they are available in [Survey Solutions](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/release-notes/).


[^1]:  The [SurveySolutionsAPIv2 (httr2 version)](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPIv2) package uses several of the functions from the `susographql` package.
